longCondition = adx > 25 and rsi > 50 and macd > macdSignal and 
                close > bbUpper and close > highest(high, 20)[1] and 
                (londonSession or nySession)

shortCondition = adx > 25 and rsi < 50 and macd < macdSignal and 
                 close < bbLower and close < lowest(low, 20)[1] and 
                 (londonSession or nySession)

// Risk management
stopLoss = longCondition ? close - (1.5 * atr) : close + (1.5 * atr)
takeProfit = longCondition ? close + (3.0 * atr) : close - (3.0 * atr)
